# 🧠 Generative AI Projects – Learning with LangChain & Huggingface

Welcome to my personal learning repository on **Generative AI**, based on the course  
📘 *"Complete Generative AI Course with LangChain and Huggingface"* by **Krish Naik**.

This repo contains the projects, code snippets, and notes I'm working on as I learn how to build, deploy, and optimize generative AI applications using cutting-edge tools.

## 📚 What I’m Learning

Through this course, I'm gaining hands-on experience with:

- 🔗 Building advanced **Generative AI applications** using the LangChain framework.
- 🤖 Integrating **Huggingface models** for language generation and transformation.
- 🧠 Understanding architecture and design patterns for robust AI systems.
- 🚀 Deploying models across **cloud platforms** and **local environments**.
- 📡 Creating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines.
- 🛠️ Fine-tuning Huggingface models for specific use cases.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The structure may evolve as I progress, but here's a general overview:

- `langchain_projects/` – Small projects using LangChain
- `huggingface_demos/` – Experiments with Huggingface models
- `rag_pipeline/` – Retrieval-Augmented Generation experiments
- `deployment/` – Scripts and tests for model deployment
- `notes/` – My personal summaries and key takeaways
